This folder contains the implementation of Arlequin and Nitsche method for coupling discretisations
and models. The sub-folders are explained in what follows.

1. 2D: 2D discretisations coupling
2. 3D: 3D discretisations coupling
3. arlequin: Arlequin implementation for 2D meshes coupling
4. continuum-beam: 
5. continuum-plate: 
6. fem: solve problems solved in other folders using mono-models.

For almost cases, the basis functions are either linear Lagrange basis or NURBS. For the latter, the files end with
IGA.m.
